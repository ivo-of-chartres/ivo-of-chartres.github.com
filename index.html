  <h1>Ivo of Chartres: work in progress</h1>

<p>This site has four elements: draft texts and some concordances for
the three collections traditionally associated with Ivo of Chartres, the
Collectio Tripartita, the Decretum and the Panormia, and a draft list of
manuscripts which contain a significant number of Ivo’s letters. Each
element differs in its method of construction, the contribution made by
each of those involved, and in its state of development. The principles
on which they have been prepared are explained in the introduction to
each. Throughout our work we have drawn very heavily on the support of
the Stephan Kuttner Institute for Medieval Canon Law at Munich. Special
thanks are due to the President, Professor Peter Landau, and to Dr Joerg
Müller for their unfailing generosity. The IRHT at Orléans has also been
extremely hospitable and generous with material. Matthew Brett gave us
technical support, and we are very grateful to Rufus Pollock, who has
advised us on many issues, and introduced us to Knowledge Forge.
</p>

<p>The purpose of making such provisional texts available, with all
their errors and gaps, is to encourage others to correct and develop
what we have done for the common profit. It is our hope that the
collaborative work of other scholars will over time convert these
first sketches into a solid body of secure learning. Accordingly, we
ask any who use the site to inform us of our errors and supply our
deficiencies. We have already received a great deal of assistance from
others, whose names are listed in the introduction to each text, and
undertake to identify the contribution of all our further
correspondents in any later revision of the site. The contributors
offer this work for others to use, criticise, and extend as they wish,
under the <a
href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0">Creative Commons
attribution and share alike license</a>.  They do not intend to
pre-empt a more systematic publication by others. On the contrary,
they hope this work may provoke one.</p>

<p>Bruce Brasington (bbrasington@mail.wtamu.edu) is jointly responsible for
the Panormia section. The Tripartita texts and annotated Decretum were
originally the responsibility of Martin Brett (mbr110@gmail.com), with much
help from Bruce and others listed there; the development of the Tripartita is
now in the the hands of Przemyslaw Nowak (p-nowak@gmx.de). The handlist of
manuscripts of the letters is the work of Christof Rolker
(Christof.Rolker@uni-konstanz.de).</p>
