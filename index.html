This site has four elements: texts and some concordances for the three
collections traditionally associated with Ivo of Chartres, the <i>Collectio
Tripartita</i>, the <i>Decretum</i> and the <i>Panormia</i>, and a list of
manuscripts which contain a significant number of Ivo’s letters. A further
draft list of sermons is in preparation. Each element differs in its method of
construction, the contribution made by each of those involved, and in its state
of development. The principles on which they have been prepared are explained
in the introduction to each. We owe a great debt to the Stephan Kuttner
Institute for Medieval Canon Law at Munich and to the President, Professor
Peter Landau, and to Dr Joerg Müller for their unfailing generosity. The IRHT
at Orléans has also been extremely helpful.  The British Academy provided a
grant for the purchase of microfilm.  Essential technical support has
been provided by Matthew Brett. Rufus Pollock introduced us to Knowledge Forge,
which hosted the site for many years.

<p>
Such provisional texts are intended to encourage others to correct and develop
what we have done for the common profit. We hope that other scholars will over
time convert these first sketches into a solid body of secure learning, capable
of producing more systematic publication by others. Accordingly, we ask any who
use the site to inform us of our errors and supply our deficiencies. The authors
would be delighted by just criticism.  Bruce Brasington is jointly responsible
for the Panormia section. The Tripartita texts and the annotated Decretum were
originally the responsibility of Martin Brett, with much help from Bruce and
others listed there; the handlist of manuscripts of the letters is mostly the
work of Christof Rolker; the Tripartita site is now in the first instance under
the care of Przemysław Nowak of Warsaw (p-nowak@gmx.de).

The photographs come from the late-seventeenth-century choir stalls of the
Augustinian priory of Oignies in Hainault (dissolved 1796), placed in the
parish church of St John at Cockayne Hatley (Beds) in 1826 by Henry Cust, for
whom they had been bought by the noted connoisseur and collector Col. Robert
Rushbrooke. C. Tracy, <i>Continental church furniture in England</i> (2001),
