  <h1>Ivo of Chartres: work in progress</h1>

<p>
This site has four elements: draft texts and some concordances for the three
collections traditionally associated with Ivo of Chartres, the Collectio
Tripartita, the Decretum and the Panormia, and a draft lists of manuscripts
which contain a significant number of Ivo’s letters. A further draft list of
sermons is in preparation. Each element differs in its method of construction,
the contribution made by each of those involved, and in its state of
development. The principles on which they have been prepared are explained in
the introduction to each. Throughout our work we have drawn very heavily on
the support of the Stephan Kuttner Institute for Medieval Canon Law at Munich.
Special thanks are due to the President, Professor Peter Landau, and to Dr
Joerg Müller for their unfailing generosity. The IRHT at Orléans has also been
extremely hospitable and generous with material. At an early stage of the work
the British Academy provided a valuable grant for the purchase of microfilm.
Essential technical support has been provided by Matthew Brett, and we are
equally grateful to Rufus Pollock, who introduced us to Knowledge Forge, which
hosted the site for many years.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of making such provisional texts available, with all their errors
and gaps, is to encourage others to correct and develop what we have done for
the common profit. It is our hope that the collaborative work of other
scholars will over time convert these first sketches into a solid body of
secure learning. Accordingly, we ask any who use the site to inform us of our
errors and supply our deficiencies. We have already received a great deal of
assistance from others, whose names are listed in the introduction to each
text, and undertake to identify the contribution of all our further
correspondents in any later revision of the site. The contributors offer this
work for others to use, criticise, and extend as they wish, under the <a
href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0">Creative Commons
attribution and share alike license</a>; they would be almost as gratified by
any acknowledgement of their work as they would be by just criticism. They do
not wish to pre-empt a more systematic publication by others. On the contrary,
they hope this work may provoke one.

Bruce Brasington (bbrasington@mail.wtamu.edu) is jointly responsible for the
Panormia section. The Tripartita texts and annotated Decretum were originally
the responsibility of Martin Brett (mbr110@gmail.com), with much help from
Bruce and others listed there; the development of the Tripartita is now in the
the hands of Przemyslaw Nowak (p-nowak@gmx.de). The handlist of manuscripts of
the letters is the work of Christof Rolker (Christof.Rolker@uni-konstanz.de).
